{{define "MyWelcome"}}
<p>Welcome! This site is running the Bookmark Warrior software written by
<a href="https://wesleycoakley.com/">Wesley Coakley</a>; Bookmark Warrior
is an ad-free, ultra-minimal bookmarking service; available on
all your devices, there's no reason to use anything else! Making an account
is simple and it only costs a nominal fee to start today (just check out our
account creation page</p>
Because we are <strong>the non-invasive solution</strong> allowing you access
to all your bookmarks from your phone, your computer, your e-reader, your
tablet, (even your smart-fridge!) Bookmark Warrior focuses especially on
simplicity and accessibility... This lets us serve you with the speed and
reliability you deserve.</p>
<p>Where other sites (e.g. Reddit) focus on aggregating content and creating
social communities, Bookmark Warrior is your <strong>personal bookmarking
site</strong>; you can add links to Bookmark Warrior and mark them as "read"
(as you finish reading them) or "archive" them for later. And most
importantly, you'll only ever see the links that are <strong>relevant to
you</strong>!</p>
