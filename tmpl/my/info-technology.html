<h1>Technology</h1>
<p>Bookmark Warrior is backended in <a href="https://golang.org/">the Go
programming language</a>, a statically typed and compiled language. The
source-code of Bookmark Warrior is not publicly available but I reserve
the right to release the software as open-source at any time; in this case it is
(highly) likely that the code will be released under a modified BSD 3-clause license.
We also leverage a local MySQL server to store your bookmarks and
session information.</p>
<p>Bookmark Warrior does not sell your data to third parties; we don't even use
analytics on our site! Payment processing is handled by successive calls to PayPal's API; we
do not handle payments on-site; PayPal requires Javascript to be enabled
on this site.</p>
<p>I am always looking for talented help; if you would like to join the
BookmarkWarrior team, please e-mail me at <a

<h2>Password Security</h2>
<p>As stated in our <a href="{{.Settings.Canon.Web}}privacy">Privacy Policy</a>,
<strong>we do not store passwords at all</strong>; instead, a one-way password
hashing algorithm called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">Bcrypt</a> is
used to ecrypt your password; even in the case of a database breach your password will
never be seen (because of the one-way nature of hashing algorithms and the
security afforded by bcrypt); bcrypt has a <em>cost</em> parameter which can be adjusted
to increase the complexity required to compute the hash, thereby
(essentially) future-proofing the hashing algorithm against brute force
attacks.</p>
