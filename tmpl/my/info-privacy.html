<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Bookmark Warrior places strong emphasis on user privacy and data integrity;
the entire site is secured using signed SSL certificates which facilitate
the secure transmission of sensitive information (like when you log in). SSL
is just one of the many measures we take to protect your privacy</p>
<p>Your password is stored using a cryptographically secure, one-way hashing
algorithm which prevents even me from reading your password from the database.
This deters hackers and bad actors from accessing your sensitive data even
in the event of a data breach; if information is ever leaked to a 3rd party,
I promise to notify all users of the event and to take appropriate action to
mitigate the risk of similar attacks in the future; independent audits
of the backend source-code may be allowed in this case to ensure your
continued security.</p>
<p>Bookmark Warrior runs on a server which only I have access to; the computer
is secured physically behind a lock and is provisioned on my network to only
accept incoming secure connections. The BookmarkWarrior software is not
available to the public but may be independently audited (only with my
permission) to address any security concerns.</p>
<p>No credit card numbers or other payment information is stored on Bookmark
Warrior because the payment processing is entirely handled by PayPal; you may
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">consult their
privacy policy</a> in the event of any questions you have while using their
payment processing service.</p>
