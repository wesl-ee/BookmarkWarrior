<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first version of Bookmark Warrior was written around January/February
2020; it aimed to upend
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking">social bookmarking</a>
sites like Reddit, Pocket and Pinboard. We are entirely user-supported with
zero recurring costs; we'll never run ads or ask for recurring membership
fees.</p>
<p>Bookmark Warrior is written, developed, maintained and operated by me,

in my senior year of Electrical / Computer engineering at
